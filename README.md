Desgined and implemented a system called Masai univeristy.

I have created a form where in students' information like Name, Gender, Section, Exam Type , 
Marks for various subjects is been taken, and a brief description about the student is updated by
teachers.

When you login with username and pwd and fill the form and click on the Button named show, it 
displays the entire form in the table given below.
It also allows you to calculate and ascertain the average, minimum, maximum and the grade when clicked on the 
respective button.
